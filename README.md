# RainbowMode
This project is a simple Bukkit plugin that I did as a challenge with [@ipodtouch0218](https://www.github.com/ipodtouch0218). The goal is to create a plugin in as few bytes as possible that allows you to toggle *Rainbow Mode*. When *Rainbow Mode* is enabled, all chat messages have rainbow color codes applied.


- **Command:** `/rainbowmode`
- **Permission:** `RainbowMode.toggle`
- **JAR size:** 3,895 bytes
